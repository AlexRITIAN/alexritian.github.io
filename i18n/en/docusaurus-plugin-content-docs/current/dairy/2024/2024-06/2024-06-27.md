## Running nohup in zsh

When running `nohup xxx &` in `zsh` to execute a task in the background, you might encounter the message `zsh: you have running jobs.` upon exiting. Exiting again will successfully close `zsh`, but the background task will also terminate.

***Solution***: Use `nohup xx &!` to prevent `zsh` from terminating the task when exiting by using `!`.
