### Accessing a Website with NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID Error in Edge

When trying to visit a website and encountering the error `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` in Edge, it means the browser cannot verify the website's certificate authority. This can happen for various reasons, including an invalid or self-signed certificate.

#### Error Message

```
Your connection isn't private
Attackers might be trying to steal your information from apim-portal-backend.gw-wso2t-sy-in.earth.xcloud.lenovo.com (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards).
NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID
```

To bypass this error and access the website, you can force entry by typing `thisisunsafe` on the error page. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Navigate to the error page in Edge.**
2. **Click anywhere on the page (not on a link or button).**
3. **Type `thisisunsafe` without quotes.**

This action will bypass the security warning, allowing you to access the website. 

### Important Note

Bypassing this error can expose you to potential security risks, such as data interception or malware. Use this method only if you are sure that the website is safe and you understand the risks involved.
