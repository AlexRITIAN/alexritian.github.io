## Gradle Closure Example

Let's break down that Java method in your Gradle plugin, written using Groovy DSL. This method takes advantage of Groovy’s Closure and Delegate mechanisms. Let’s dive into each part of this code:

```java
public void forcedTypes(@DelegatesTo(ForcedTypesHandler.class) Closure<?> closure) {
    closure.setDelegate(this.forcedTypes);
    closure.setResolveStrategy(1);
    closure.call();
}
```

### Breaking it Down

1. **Method Signature**
   ```java
   public void forcedTypes(@DelegatesTo(ForcedTypesHandler.class) Closure<?> closure)
   ```
   - `public void forcedTypes(...)`: This defines a public method named `forcedTypes` with no return value.
   - `@DelegatesTo(ForcedTypesHandler.class) Closure<?> closure`: The parameter is a Groovy Closure, and the `@DelegatesTo` annotation specifies that the delegate for this closure should be of type `ForcedTypesHandler`.

2. **Setting the Closure's Delegate**
   ```java
   closure.setDelegate(this.forcedTypes);
   ```
   - `closure.setDelegate(...)`: This sets the delegate of the closure to `this.forcedTypes`, meaning it will delegate method calls to this `forcedTypes` object.

3. **Setting the Closure's Resolve Strategy**
   ```java
   closure.setResolveStrategy(1);
   ```
   - `closure.setResolveStrategy(...)`: This sets the closure's resolve strategy to 1, which corresponds to `DELEGATE_FIRST`. This means the closure will look for properties and methods on the delegate object first.

4. **Calling the Closure**
   ```java
   closure.call();
   ```
   - `closure.call()`: This executes the closure.

### What’s the Point?

This kind of code is typical in Gradle plugins to allow users to configure `forcedTypes` in a more intuitive way using DSL. When a user calls `forcedTypes { ... }` in their Gradle script, the closure they pass in is dynamically bound to the `forcedTypes` object. This allows users to directly configure `forcedTypes` within the closure, like this:

```groovy
forcedTypes {
    type {
        name = 'VARCHAR'
        expression = '.*'
    }
}
```

In this example, the configuration inside the `forcedTypes` closure applies directly to the `forcedTypes` object, making the setup process simpler.

## Adding Dependencies Dynamically in a Gradle Plugin

Here's some code that dynamically adds dependencies in a Gradle plugin. It does this by calling `project.getDependencies().addProvider`, which adds a dependency to a specific configuration. Let’s break it down:

```java
project.getDependencies().addProvider(
    sourceSet.getImplementationConfigurationName(),
    jooqExtension.getEdition().map(e -> e.getGroupId() + ":jooq")
                .flatMap(ga -> jooqExtension.getVersion().map(v -> ga + ":" + v))
);
```

### Breaking it Down

1. **Getting the Configuration Name**
   ```java
   sourceSet.getImplementationConfigurationName()
   ```
   - `sourceSet.getImplementationConfigurationName()`: This gets the implementation configuration name for the `sourceSet`. `sourceSet` typically refers to a source set in the Gradle project (like `main`, `test`, etc.), and the implementation configuration name is something like `implementation` (e.g., `mainImplementation`).

2. **Building the Dependency String**
   ```java
   jooqExtension.getEdition().map(e -> e.getGroupId() + ":jooq")
                .flatMap(ga -> jooqExtension.getVersion().map(v -> ga + ":" + v))
   ```
   - `jooqExtension.getEdition()`: Gets the `Edition` property from `jooqExtension`, which is a `Provider` object.
   - `.map(e -> e.getGroupId() + ":jooq")`: Maps the `Edition` object to a string combining its `GroupId` and `"jooq"`.
   - `.flatMap(ga -> jooqExtension.getVersion().map(v -> ga + ":" + v))`: Further maps this to combine it with the `Version` property, forming a complete dependency string like `org.jooq:jooq:3.14.8`.

3. **Adding the Dependency**
   ```java
   project.getDependencies().addProvider(...);
   ```
   - `project.getDependencies().addProvider`: This Gradle method adds a dynamically provided dependency to the specified configuration.
   - The first argument is the configuration name obtained from `sourceSet.getImplementationConfigurationName()`.
   - The second argument is the dependency coordinate string, dynamically generated from `jooqExtension`'s `Edition` and `Version` properties.

### Where Does the Dependency Go?

The dependencies added here are for the project managed by the plugin, not the plugin itself. Specifically:

- `project.getDependencies().addProvider` adds the dependency to the specified configuration of the project using the plugin.
- `sourceSet` represents the source set of the project using the plugin, so the dependency is added to that project’s implementation configuration.

## Wrapping Up the Dependency Add

In summary, this code dynamically gets the `Edition` and `Version` properties from `jooqExtension`, creates the dependency coordinate string, and adds this dependency to the implementation configuration of the source set in the project using the plugin. This way, users can configure their project dependencies flexibly via the `jooqExtension` without manually adding them in their build scripts.

## Gradle Property.finalizeValueOnRead()

In Gradle, the `Property` interface provides a flexible, type-safe way to handle properties. The `finalizeValueOnRead()` method is part of the `Property` interface and controls the lifecycle and mutability of the property value.

### Breaking it Down

```java
private final Property<String> version;
private final Property<JooqEdition> edition;
```
- These lines define two private, final properties, `version` and `edition`. They are of type `Property`, which is a Gradle interface for handling properties.

```java
version.finalizeValueOnRead();
edition.finalizeValueOnRead();
```
- `finalizeValueOnRead()` is called on these properties. This method fixes the property value upon first read, making it immutable afterward.

### What's `finalizeValueOnRead()` About?

The main job of `finalizeValueOnRead()` is to control the immutability of a property. Specifically:

- **Fixing the Property Value**: Once the property value is read, it’s locked in (finalized). This means after the first read, you can’t change it anymore.
- **Ensuring Consistency**: In some cases, you want to ensure that once a property value is used, it remains consistent and doesn’t change. This helps maintain consistent configuration and prevents potential issues from concurrent modifications.
- **Preventing Subsequent Modifications**: After calling `finalizeValueOnRead()`, any attempt to modify the property value after it has been read will throw an exception. This helps catch and prevent unintended changes.

### Use Cases

This method is typically used in scenarios like:

- **Lazy Initialization**: The property value might be dynamically computed or set during plugin or task execution. Before it’s read, it can be mutable.
- **Configuration Locking**: Once configuration values are read, lock them to prevent further changes, ensuring the task or plugin behavior remains predictable.
- **Ensuring Safety**: In a multithreaded environment, ensure a property, once read, isn’t modified by other threads, avoiding concurrency issues.

### Example

```java
public class MyPluginExtension {
    private final Property<String> version;
    private final Property<JooqEdition> edition;

    @Inject
    public MyPluginExtension(ObjectFactory objects) {
        this.version = objects.property(String.class);
        this.edition = objects.property(JooqEdition.class);

        version.finalizeValueOnRead();
        edition.finalizeValueOnRead();
    }

    // Getter and setter methods
    public Property<String> getVersion() {
        return version;
    }

    public Property<JooqEdition> getEdition() {
        return edition;
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `version` and `edition` are properties whose values are fixed upon first read.
- `version.finalizeValueOnRead();` and `edition.finalizeValueOnRead();` ensure that these properties’ values cannot be changed after being read for the first time.

### Wrapping It Up

The `finalizeValueOnRead()` method fixes the property value upon first read to ensure consistency and stability throughout the build process. This mechanism helps prevent unexpected changes in configuration at runtime, making plugin or task behavior predictable and reliable.
