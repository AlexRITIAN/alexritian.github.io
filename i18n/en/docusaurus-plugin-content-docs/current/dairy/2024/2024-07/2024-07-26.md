Today, I received an email from Stack Overflow. I realized that ever since I started using ChatGPT, I haven't logged into Stack Overflow. Before GPT, Stack Overflow was the site I visited the most to look up solutions to my problems.


### Arch Linux Font Priority Configuration

On Arch Linux, you can prioritize specific fonts by setting up font configuration files. Here are the steps:

1. **View Installed Fonts:**

   Use `fc-list` to view the `family` names of installed fonts.

   ```shell
   fc-list :family | sort | uniq
   ```

2. **Create Font Configuration File:**
   Create or edit the `/etc/fonts/local.conf` file to set font priorities.

   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/fonts/local.conf
   ```

3. **Configure Font Priorities:**
   Add the following content to the `local.conf` file:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
   <fontconfig>
     <!-- Prioritize LXGW Wenkai font for displaying Chinese -->
     <match>
       <test name="lang" compare="contains">
         <string>zh</string>
       </test>
       <edit name="family" mode="prepend">
         <string>LXGW Wenkai</string>
       </edit>
     </match>

     <!-- Prioritize JetBrains Mono font for displaying English -->
     <match>
       <test name="lang" compare="not_contains">
         <string>zh</string>
       </test>
       <edit name="family" mode="prepend">
         <string>JetBrains Mono</string>
       </edit>
     </match>
   </fontconfig>
   ```

4. **Refresh Font Cache:**
   Save and close the file, then refresh the font cache to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   fc-cache -fv
   ```

After configuring this, the system will prioritize using the `LXGW Wenkai` font to display Chinese and the `JetBrains Mono` font to display English. If you notice that the fonts are not correctly applied in some applications, you may need to manually specify these fonts in the application's font settings.
