### Java Code Example with `@Value`

For a requirement where you need to read values from a configuration file into a `List<Integer>` property, you can use the `@Value` annotation to achieve this.

#### YAML Configuration

```yaml
api:
  ids: 1,2,3
```

#### Java Code

```java
@Value("#{'${api.ids}'.split(',')}")
private List<Integer> ids;
```

:::warning
If you use `@Value("${api.ids}")` directly, it will throw an error and fail to parse. However, it will work correctly if the type is `List<String>`.
