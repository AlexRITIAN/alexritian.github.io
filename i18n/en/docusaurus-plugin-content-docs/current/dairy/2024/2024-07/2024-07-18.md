### Personal Experience with `Hyperland` and Arch Linux

A couple of weeks ago, I saw someone sharing their `Hyperland` ricing online, and it looked amazing. I wanted to install it on my `arch` system. However, after installation, I couldn't get to the desktop. My laptop has an Nvidia RTX 4060. I tried for a long time, but it just didn't work. I was so frustrated!

Due to work needs, I temporarily used the Windows system to get things done. This week, I finally had time to restore `arch`. After trying many desktops, I found that `gnome` supports my graphics card better and meets my needs. So, I switched back to the `gnome` desktop.
