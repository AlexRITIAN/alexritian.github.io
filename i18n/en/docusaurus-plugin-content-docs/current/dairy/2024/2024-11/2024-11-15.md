## Gradle Version Catalog

This article explains how to define dependency versions in the **Gradle Version Catalog**, focusing on two main approaches: **Plain Version Declarations** and **Rich Version Declarations**.

---

### 1. Plain Version Declaration (Required Version)

* Uses a simple string to declare the version—equivalent to “you must use exactly this version.”

* Example:

  ```toml
  [versions]
  other-lib = "5.5.0"
  ```

* **Explanation**:

  * The dependency `other-lib` is locked to version `5.5.0`.
  * This method is straightforward but offers no flexibility.

---

### 2. Rich Version Declaration

* Rich Version Declarations allow you to specify version requirements through multiple rules, offering greater flexibility.

* Example:

  ```toml
  [versions]
  my-lib = { strictly = "[1.0, 2.0[", prefer = "1.2" }
  ```

* **Explanation**:

  * `strictly = "[1.0, 2.0["` enforces that the version must be within the range `[1.0, 2.0[` (inclusive of `1.0`, exclusive of `2.0`).
  * `prefer = "1.2"` indicates that, if possible, version `1.2` should be chosen.
  * When both `strictly` and `prefer` apply, Gradle will pick `1.2` because it satisfies the range.

---

### 3. Supported Properties in Rich Versions

#### 3.1 **require**: Mandatory Version

* Equivalent to a plain version declaration.
* If `require` is set, all other rules are ignored.

  ```toml
  [versions]
  lib = { require = "3.5.0" }
  ```

#### 3.2 **strictly**: Strict Version Range

* Constrains the version to a specific range; Gradle will fail if a version outside this range is resolved.
* Common range syntax:

  * `[1.0, 2.0]` — closed interval (includes both `1.0` and `2.0`).
  * `[1.0, 2.0[` — half-open interval (includes `1.0`, excludes `2.0`).
  * `(1.0, 2.0)` — open interval (excludes both endpoints).

    ```toml
    [versions]
    lib = { strictly = "[1.0, 2.0]" }
    ```

#### 3.3 **prefer**: Preferred Version

* Specifies which version to choose when multiple candidates satisfy the constraints.
* If `strictly` is not set, `prefer` alone will determine the version.

  ```toml
  [versions]
  lib = { prefer = "1.2.3" }
  ```

#### 3.4 **reject**: Excluded Versions

* Lists specific versions that must be excluded, even if they meet other constraints.

  ```toml
  [versions]
  lib = { reject = ["1.0", "1.1"] }
  ```
* **Explanation**:

  * Versions `1.0` and `1.1` are explicitly forbidden.

#### 3.5 **rejectAll**: Exclude All Versions

* When `rejectAll = true`, no versions are allowed (useful to temporarily disable a dependency).

  ```toml
  [versions]
  lib = { rejectAll = true }
  ```

---

### 4. Use Cases and Rule Precedence

#### 4.1 **require**

* If `require` is present, Gradle ignores `strictly`, `prefer`, and other rules, enforcing the exact version.

#### 4.2 **strictly + prefer**

* `strictly` establishes the allowed range, and `prefer` selects your favorite version within that range.

  ```toml
  [versions]
  lib = { strictly = "[1.0, 2.0]", prefer = "1.5" }
  ```
* If available versions are `1.2`, `1.5`, and `1.8`, they all satisfy `[1.0, 2.0]`, but Gradle will choose `1.5`.

#### 4.3 **strictly + reject**

* Combine `strictly` and `reject` to both constrain the range and exclude certain versions.

  ```toml
  [versions]
  lib = { strictly = "[1.0, 2.0]", reject = ["1.3"] }
  ```
* Given candidates `1.2`, `1.3`, and `1.5`, version `1.3` is removed from consideration; Gradle picks `1.2` or `1.5`.

#### 4.4 **rejectAll**

* When set to `true`, no version can be selected, causing dependency resolution to fail—useful for debugging or temporarily disabling a library.

---

### 5. Complete Example

```toml
[versions]
lib = { strictly = "[1.0, 2.0[", prefer = "1.5", reject = ["1.3", "1.4"] }
```

* **strictly**: Range `[1.0, 2.0[`.
* **prefer**: Preferred version `1.5`.
* **reject**: Forbids versions `1.3` and `1.4`.

---

## Summary

Gradle’s Rich Versions feature empowers you to finely control your dependency versions:

* **require** to lock a version absolutely.
* **strictly** to enforce a range.
* **prefer** to steer resolution toward a favored release.
* **reject** and **rejectAll** to explicitly exclude problematic or unwanted versions.

These mechanisms help ensure build stability and precise conflict management in complex projects.

**Usage in `build.gradle.kts`:**

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.lib) {
        version {
            strictly("1.6")
        }
    }
}
```
