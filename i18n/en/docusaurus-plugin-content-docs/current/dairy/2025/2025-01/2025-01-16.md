## How to Move a Running Command to the Background

In Linux, if you’ve already started a command in the foreground and want to continue it in the background, you can do so without restarting it. The basic workflow is: (1) suspend the process with **Ctrl + Z**, (2) resume it with **bg**, (3) detach it from your terminal with **disown**, and (4) verify its status with **jobs**. This ensures your command keeps running even after you close the shell.

---

### 1. Suspend the Current Process

Press:

```bash
Ctrl + Z
```

This stops (pauses) the running command and returns you to the shell prompt:

```
[1]+  Stopped   your-command
```

---

### 2. Resume in the Background

Enter:

```bash
bg
```

This will restart the most recently suspended job in the background:

```
[1]+ your-command &
```

---

### 3. Prevent Termination on Terminal Close

By default, background jobs receive a SIGHUP (hangup) signal when the terminal closes and may be terminated. To avoid this, run:

```bash
disown
```

This removes the job from the shell’s job table so it won’t be sent a hangup signal upon exit.

---

### 4. Check Background Jobs

To list all jobs and their states, use:

```bash
jobs
```

You’ll see output like:

```
[1]+  Running   your-command &
```


---

With these steps, your previously foreground command is now running in the background and will persist even if you close the terminal.
