## Deploying a Docker Registry

To provide a pull-through cache for servers that cannot access Docker Hub, you can deploy an instance of the official Docker Registry on a machine with Docker Hub access.

---

### 1. Create the Registry Configuration File

Create a file at `/path/to/config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: 0.1
proxy:
  remoteurl: https://registry-1.docker.io
```

* **version: 0.1**
  Specifies the configuration schema version.
* **proxy.remoteurl**
  Points to the Docker Hub endpoint (`https://registry-1.docker.io` by default).

This configuration tells your Registry that, whenever a requested image is not found locally, it should fetch and cache it from Docker Hub.

---

### 2. Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

Create an nginx configuration file at `/path/to/registry.conf`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name domain.name;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/cert/domain.name.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/cert/domain.name.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

* **listen 443 ssl;**
  Listens for HTTPS traffic on port 443.
* **server\_name**
  Your registry’s domain name.
* **ssl\_certificate / ssl\_certificate\_key**
  Paths to your TLS certificate and private key.
* **location /**
  Proxies all incoming requests to the registry running on `localhost:5000`, forwarding common headers.

---

### 3. Run the Registry Container

With Docker installed, launch the registry container, mounting your configuration:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name registry \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml \
  registry:2
```

* **-p 5000:5000**
  Exposes the registry on port 5000.
* **-v /path/to/config.yaml**
  Binds your custom configuration into the container.
* **registry:2**
  Uses the official Registry image (version 2).

---

### 4. Verify and Use the Pull-Through Cache

1. **Test Pulling an Image**

   ```bash
   docker pull domain.name/myimage:tag
   ```

   The first pull fetches from Docker Hub, caching it locally.

2. **Subsequent Pulls**
   Subsequent pulls for the same image/tag will be served from your local cache, reducing Docker Hub traffic.

3. **Cleanup (Optional)**
   You can configure garbage collection in the registry to reclaim space from untagged or expired blobs. See the [Docker Registry Garbage Collection documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/garbage-collection/) for details.

---

By deploying a pull-through registry behind an HTTPS reverse proxy, you enable isolated environments to mirror and cache Docker Hub images securely and efficiently.
