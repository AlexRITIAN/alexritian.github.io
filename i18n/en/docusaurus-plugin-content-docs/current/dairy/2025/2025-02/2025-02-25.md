“A thousand miles of yellow clouds dim the daylight; north winds drive wild geese through swirling snow.”

  A thousand miles of yellow clouds dim the daylight; north winds drive wild geese through swirling snow.  
  <br>Do not worry that no kindred spirits lie ahead; everyone under heaven knows you.  
  <br>With six wings I flutter, pitying myself—more than ten years since I left the capital.  
  <br>A man’s poverty and lowliness are no shame, yet today we meet with no money for wine.

## Removing the `version` Field in Docker Compose

Starting with Docker Compose 2.0, you no longer need to include the `version` field in your `docker-compose.yaml`. Whereas earlier versions required `version` to determine the file format, Compose now auto-detects the format and thus deprecates this field.

### Why Is `version` No Longer Needed?

1. **Automatic Compatibility Detection**
   Docker Compose now infers the file format based on the features you’ve used, eliminating the need for a manually specified version.

2. **Simplified Configuration**
   Dropping the `version` field makes your `docker-compose.yaml` cleaner and avoids confusion caused by unnecessary metadata.
