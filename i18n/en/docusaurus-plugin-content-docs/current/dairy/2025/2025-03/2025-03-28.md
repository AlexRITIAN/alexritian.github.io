"A noble man dies for one who truly knew him, sword in hand, departing the capital of Yan."
— "Ode to Jing Ke" by Tao Yuanming, Wei-Jin Period

  <summary>全文</summary>
Prince Dan of Yan nurtured heroes with care,<br/>
His heart set on vengeance against mighty Ying.<br/>
He summoned a hundred valiant men,<br/>
And at year’s end, Jing Qing came to his wing.<br/>

"A noble soul dies for a friend who understands,<br/>
Sword in hand, he strides from Yan’s capital."<br/>
White steeds neigh on the boundless road,<br/>
As comrades send him off, hearts full and full.<br/>

His wrathful hair pierces his perilous crown,<br/>
Fierce spirit surges through his warrior’s sash.<br/>
They drink farewell by the River Yi’s edge,<br/>
Heroes gather, their valor aflame in the clash.<br/>

Gao Jianli strikes the mournful zhu,<br/>
Song Yi’s voice soars, bold and profound.<br/>
The mournful wind whispers its sorrows,<br/>
Cold ripples rise, silent and unbound.<br/>

The Shang note brings tears anew,<br/>
The Yu melody stirs the warrior’s dread.<br/>
He knows this path leads not to return,<br/>
Yet his name shall live when he is dead.<br/>

He mounts his chariot, never looking back,<br/>
Speeds like wind to Qin’s imperial court.<br/>
Swift he traverses ten thousand miles,<br/>
Winding through cities, his mission his fort.<br/>

The map unfurls, the plot is revealed,<br/>
The tyrant trembles, gripped by fear.<br/>
Alas! His blade lacked the final skill,<br/>
The grand endeavor failed, yet crystal-clear:<br/>

Though he perished in dust and strife,<br/>
A thousand years still sing his story—
Such passion echoes beyond his life,<br/>
Etched in the annals of eternal glory.

**Issue with sudo Command Execution**

Today, I encountered a problem with `sudo`. The `cfssl` command works fine under a **regular user** and **root user**, but when I tried running `sudo cfssl` as the regular user, it prompted `sudo: cfssl: command not found`.  

Upon investigation, I discovered that the `PATH` loaded by `sudo` is neither the regular user's nor root's. Instead, it uses the `secure_path` configured in `/etc/sudoers`:

```
Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
```

This configuration does not include `/usr/local/bin`, where `cfssl` might be installed. There are two solutions:  
1. Add `/usr/local/bin` to the `secure_path` in `/etc/sudoers`.  
2. Move the `cfssl` binary to `/usr/bin`.  

This addresses the issue by ensuring `sudo` can locate the command in its restricted path.
